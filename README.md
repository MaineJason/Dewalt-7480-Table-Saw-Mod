Files and information pertaining to the video "Upgrading A Dewalt Table Saw To Accept A Dado Blade Set" - https://youtu.be/2370zWSBGE0

The two files in this repository are as follows:

1.  Dewalt Table Saw Shield Gasket v3.stl  -  this is the raw, uncut STL.
2.  Dewalt Table Saw Shield Gasket v3.3mf  -  This is a cut version with two plates for Bambu Studio (the one I used in the video)

I used regular PLA for the print.
